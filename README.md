# Dibs

Dibs is a reservation application targeted for barbsershops/salons. The platform enables registration as a customer or as an owner;
owners are able to reigster shops and babers, where customers are then able to make reservations. Dibs provides owners the ability
to visualize their schedules throughout the day as well as showcase their barbershop to potential customers.


## Project Description

Our project will be a reservation app for barbershops/salons. The application will have two user roles:
an owner and a customer. An owner will be able to create a barbershop on the site and input capacity/time
slots that customers can then reserve. Owners will then be able to holistically see their schedule for the
day and other statistics (i.e. avg reservations, avg idle time, etc.). Sufficient logic will be in place
to prevent double booking and overcrowding. An additional feature we may add if time permits is a review
system where users can review barbershops/barbers.
